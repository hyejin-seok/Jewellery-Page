# Jewellery eCommerce Page

## Description

This is the first landing page I built, where I designed the entire structure and logo myself. My goal was to use only HTML and CSS, without relying on any CSS libraries. I implemented the rotating testimonials section and the hamburger navigation bar using only pure CSS, without any JavaScript.
This project was a great opportunity to practice and refine my basic HTML and CSS skills.

## Technology

HTML, CSS
