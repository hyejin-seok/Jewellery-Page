# Jewellery eCommerce Page

## Description

This is the first landing page I built, where I designed the entire structure and logo independently, aiming for a clean and efficient user interface. <br><br>
My goal was to use only HTML and CSS, without relying on any CSS libraries. I implemented dynamic features such as a rotating testimonials section and a responsive hamburger navigation bar using pure CSS, avoiding the need for JavaScript. <br><br>
This project was a great opportunity to practice and refine my basic HTML and CSS skills.
